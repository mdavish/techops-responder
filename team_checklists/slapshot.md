For Slapshot to assess your ticket you must provide:

1. A link to the external web page where the error is appearing. (This should be
   a link to a page outside of the Yext platform, like bestbuy.com for example.
   It should not have a yext.com domain.)
2. A link to the Yext Pages in the platform (the link should be in the format
   https://www.yext.com/s/<YOUR_BUSINESS_ID>/sites/<SITE_ID>/features/)
3. Screenshots or videos of the error or the issue you are experiencing.
