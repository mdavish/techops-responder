For Raiden to properly triage the ticket, the following are necessary:

1. A link to the page where the error is appearing.
2. A list of instructions on how to replicate the issue. A video of the issue
   being replicated is also acceptable.
3. A description of what the ideal/expected behavior is, and how it is different
   from the current behavior.
